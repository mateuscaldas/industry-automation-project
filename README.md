# industry-automation-project

Project made by me for Industry 4.0 course of Eletric Engineer Master's of Polytechnic Institute of Leiria.

The objective of this project was to in to put in practice the lessons learned in the course about Industry 4.0
and OPC-UA.

The scenario given was:

Under an Industry 4.0 business model, a manufacturer of Injection Moulding Machines (IMM)
supplies the use of the machines as a service. Its clients, manufacturers of plastic parts, have the
machines installed on their own facilities and are responsible for their operation, but they do not own
the machine, they merely rent its service. The installation, maintenance and repairs are the
responsibility of the machine’s manufacturer.
Besides the use of the machines, the manufacturer also supplies technological solutions for
managing the processes and to interface with the client’s systems.
In this assignment, it will be considered, as an example, the production of parts to the automobile
industry. O manufacturer of the injection moulding machines is called ManufacturerX, the
manufacturer of the plastic parts is called ManufacturerY, and the automobile manufacturer, that
buys the parts is called ManufacturerZ. 

The part of the connection with ManufacturerX was not made by me, that's this part is not inside this repository.

This project is developed is C#, the entire code was not made by me. The base code is taken from the official 
platform of OPC-UA Foundation.
